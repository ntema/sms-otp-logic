# Node js Authentication System

## A rest api for authentication with number and otp(one time password)
I show in this project an Authentication System with OTP-One time password using node js, express js, bcrypt, jwt, all integrated into a Restful API. This is completely a backend build. This is is signup and login system. The database I used in this build is MongoDB.
